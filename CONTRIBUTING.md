# 🤝 Contributing to Prodigy Noted

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: deploy-safe, audit-ready
- `dev`: active development
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>`

## Commit Hygiene
Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation
- `chore:` cleanup

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
